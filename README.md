# cherenkov_videos
Create videos of Cherenkov shower footprints using matplotlib animations


This uses four input files produced with the [IACT/ATMO](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/~bernlohr/iact-atmo/) extension for [CORSIKA](https://www.ikp.kit.edu/corsika/index.php) compiled witht he `STORE_EMITTER` option, to get the information
by which particle a Cherenkov photon was emitted.

This information is visualized in the different color channels, red for Cherenkov photons emitted by electrons, green for muons and blue for all other particles.

The input files are huge (several GB for the single event) and thus not included here.
I can provide them on request.
